User can place a bet
Dealer gives one card faced up to each player and one to themselves faced up
Jacks, Kings, and Queens = 10
Aces - A = 1 or 11
if total is 21 you automatically win
if user wants another card, they HIT. Otherwise say STAY
once user's hand is greater than 21 you automatically loose, BUST
if dealers hand is 16 or under, they take another card. Otherwise stay with hand.
If dealer surpasses 21 they BUST, every player wins 2x their bet
if the dealer doesn't BUST only the player who's highest hand wins 2x their bet, everyone else losses their bet
If total is higher than 21, it is called a BUST  -> means you are out of the game
